## Application Setup

1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/jeremyjosol/project_name.git) by either copying the link or entering the command in your terminal:
    ```
     git clone enter_link_here
    ```
  2. After successfully cloning down the repository, navigate to the **'projectname_project'** directory, if the file is located in your desktop, enter the following command:
      ```
       cd projectname_project
3. Before you can use or deploy the project, make sure to install its dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal:

    `$ npm install`

    > _This command will read the **package.json** file and install all the required packages_.

4. Once its dependencies are installed, you're ready to perform these available options:
    
    - To build the project:
    
      `$ npm run build`

      > _This will compile and prepare the project for deployment._

    - To lint files:

      `$ npm run lint`

      > _This will analyze your code and highlight any potential issues based on your linting rules_.

    - To run tests using Jest: 
    
      `$ npm run test`

      > _This will activate the test suites you've configured in your project and provide feedback on whether they have executed successfully._
        
    - To start the local development server: 
    
      `$ npm run start` 

      > _This will launch a local server for testing and development purposes_.



You should now be set up to use, develop, and test **Project Name**. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out or refer to the project's documentation. Alternatively, if you'd like to view the project without setting up a local environment, you can access it on [Github Pages](https://jeremyjosol.github.io/aug252023_project/).
