# OpenWeather API

## Contributors

## About
This an application that features a search engine and uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to allow a user search input based on city, state, or zip code and generates real time weather results based on the input and outputs specific API parameters on the webpage. The documentation referenced is based on current weather data calls.

## Technologies Used

* _Github_
* _VSCode_
* _HTML_
* _CSS_
* _Bootstrap_
* _Javascript_
* _Node.js v16.13.1_
* _npm v8.1.2_
* _OpenWeather API_

### Prerequisuites
> _Your computer or codespace should use **Node.js version 16** or greater. For more information, see_ [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

## Application Setup

1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/jeremyjosol/sep42023_weatherapi.git) by either copying the link or entering the command in your terminal:
    ```
     git clone https://github.com/jeremyjosol/sep42023_weatherapi.git
    ```
2. After successfully cloning down the repository, navigate to the **'sep42023_weatherapi'** directory, if the file is located in your desktop, enter the following command:
      ```
       cd sep42023_weatherapi   
3. In the root directory of `sep42023_weatherapi`, enter the following command `touch .env`. This file is where you will store your API key.

4. If you don't already have an API key for [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api), create a free account to have one generated. This is required in order for the function to call on the API in this project.

5. After opening up your codespace, locate the **.env** file. Within the **.env** file, enter the following code: 
      ```
        API_KEY=yourAPIkey
      ```  
    > _.**env** will already be located in the **.gitignore** file to protect this sensitive information._

6. Before you can use or deploy the project, make sure to install its dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal:

    `$ npm install`

    > _This command will read the **package.json** file and install all the required packages_.

7. Once its dependencies are installed, you're ready to perform these available options:
    
    - To build the project:
    
      `$ npm run build`

      > _This will compile and prepare the project for deployment._

    - To lint files:

      `$ npm run lint`

      > _This will analyze your code and highlight any potential issues based on your linting rules_.

    - To run tests using Jest: 
    
      `$ npm run test`

      > _This will activate the test suites you've configured in your project and provide feedback on whether they have executed successfully._
        
    - To start the local development server: 
    
      `$ npm run start` 

      > _This will launch a local server for testing and development purposes_.


You should now be set up to use, develop, and test **OpenWeather API**. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out or refer to the project's documentation. Alternatively, if you'd like to view the project without setting up a local environment, you can access it on [Github Pages](https://jeremyjosol.github.io/sep42023_weatherapi/).
